# Feature Graphic



The left part of the graphic (i.e. not the screenshot) is created via the [Android Feature Graphic Generator](https://www.norio.be/android-feature-graphic-generator) made by Noria. It can be easily updated via this <a href="https://www.norio.be/android-feature-graphic-generator/?config=%7B%22background%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23212121%22%2C%22gradient%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22none%22%2C%22radius%22%3A%22600%22%2C%22angle%22%3A%22vertical%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23000000%22%7D%7D%2C%22title%22%3A%7B%22text%22%3A%22Sales%20Tax%20%22%2C%22position%22%3A84%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23f44336%22%2C%22size%22%3A200%2C%22font%22%3A%7B%22family%22%3A%22sans-serif%22%2C%22effect%22%3A%22bold%22%7D%7D%2C%22subtitle%22%3A%7B%22text%22%3A%22Simple%20and%20Easy%20%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23f5f5f5%22%2C%22size%22%3A100%2C%22offset%22%3A0%2C%22font%22%3A%7B%22family%22%3A%22sans-serif%22%2C%22effect%22%3A%22normal%22%7D%7D%2C%22image%22%3A%7B%22position%22%3A%220%22%2C%22positionX%22%3A%221%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%220.45%22%7D%2C%22size%22%3A%22feature-graphic%22%7D">permalink</a>.
